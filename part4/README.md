# section 4 

## Inheritance 
- The process where one class acquires, the attributes and methods of another.


## method overriding 
- Declaring a method in sub class, which is already present in parent class.
- So that a child class can give its own implementation
		
## super 
- keyword refers to the superclass (parent) of an object
- very similar to the "this" keyword

## Abstract 
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can have a subclass
- Abstract methods are declared without an implementation

## java access modifiers
- The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class
- There are four types of Java access modifiers:
   -  **Private**: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
   -  **Default**: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. 
   -  **Protected**: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class.
   -  **Public**: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere.

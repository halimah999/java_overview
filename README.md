### what is the difference between java and c++?
Before talking about difference between c++ and Java I will talk about plugin and embedded system
1. **embedded system:** Embedded systems are controllers that are handled using real-time operating systems. They are embedded in different devices such as smartphones, watches, cars, etc. to make them "smarter".
embedded systems programming that is quite different than traditional programming as it requires low-level system access and as low usage of resources as possible.


- C and C++ are a bit lower level and more complex to use, they are generally only popular in systems programming or anywhere where high levels of optimization are important.

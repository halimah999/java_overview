# java_overview

## Introdunction
 - Java is one of Top 3 most popular language
 - it is Extermely flexible (business,web app, android app,games)
 - The JDK is the development platform for building Java applications.

### what is a JDK?
- Java development kit contians developers tools
- JDK incloding JRE(Java Runtime Envirment)
- JRE contains a library and toolkits 
- java virtual machine(jvm) (run java programs)
- jvm translate code to machine code

### what is the difference between java and c++?
Before talking about difference between c++ and Java I will talk about plugin and embedded system
> 1. **embedded system:** 
>
> - An embedded system is a system in which the computer (generally a microcontroller or microprocessor) is included as an integral part of the system.<br>
> - Embedded system is controllers that is handled using real-time operating systems. it is  embedded in different devices such as smartphones, watches, cars, etc. to make them "smarter".<br>
> - embedded systems programming that is quite different than traditional programming as it requires low-level system access and as low usage of resources as possible.

> 2. **plugins system:** 
> -  is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plug-ins, it enables customization.
> -  Applications may support plug-ins to:
>
    > - enable third-party developers to extend an application
    > - support easily adding new features
    > - reduce the size of an application by not loading unused features
    > - separate source code from an application because of incompatible software licenses.

- C and C++ are a bit lower level and more complex to use, they are generally only popular in systems programming or anywhere where high levels of optimization are important.

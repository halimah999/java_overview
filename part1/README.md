# Section 1

This section contains basic of coding in java which are variables, Variable Initialization, data types, output, input, Math Class , arithmetic and logic operator, and Conditional flows

### variables :
Variable in Java is a data container that stores the data values during Java program execution

### Variable Initialization
To initialize a variable, you must assign it a valid value.
### data types
Data Types in Java are defined as specifiers that allocate different sizes and types of values that can be stored in the variable or an identifier. Data types in Java can be divided into two parts :
- **Primitive Data Types** :- which include integer, character, boolean, and float
- **Non-primitive Data Types** :- which include classes, arrays and interfaces.
